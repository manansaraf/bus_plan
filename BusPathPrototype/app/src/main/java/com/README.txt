Description:
The Bus Plan Android application uses the CUMTD bus service API in order to provide the people of Champaign-Urbana with accurate and convenient bus service information. The main features offered include a way to search of all the bus stops, a way to favorite stops for quick access, a way to view all nearby stops based on GPS location, a way to plan a trip from a certain stop to another stop, and a unique way to set up scheduled trip reminders. There are many apps out there that offer bus service information, but Bus Plan was designed in order to make the most useful actions easy to perform which can be seen for example in how the favorites are right on the front screen.
